Advanced Keylogger (Beginner) ðŸš§

Beginner level â€” For college assignment / learning purposes only.
Important: Run this project only in a controlled test environment (VM/lab machine) where you have explicit permission. Running it on someone elseâ€™s device without permission is illegal and unethical.

Project Overview

This Advanced Keylogger project is an educational tool designed to demonstrate monitoring and logging concepts such as keystroke capture, screenshots, and basic log collection. The goal is to learn how monitoring systems work and to study security concepts â€” not to misuse the software.

For College Submission

This README is prepared for assignment submission. Include the following in your submission:

Complete source code (repository)

requirements.txt (dependencies)

Short report (report.pdf) describing idea, architecture, tests, and ethics

Demo screenshots (from your test VM)

This README.md

Features (Short)

Local keystroke logging (for demo only)

Timeâ€‘stamped screenshots (sample)

Application and system log collection (sample)

Basic encrypted storage for collected data (concept/demo)

Setup (Local test environment only)

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/advanced-keylogger.git
cd advanced-keylogger


Create and activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # Linux / macOS
venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run (Controlled lab only)

Do not run this on other peopleâ€™s machines or any production devices. Use a VM or lab machine where you have permission.

Configure the .env file with test/dummy credentials if required (do not use real credentials).

Start the program inside your test VM:

python Project/keylogger.py


Perform demo activity on the same VM, then collect logs and screenshots for submission.

How to Demonstrate for Instructor

Provide 3â€“5 screenshots showing the tool running in your VM.

Attach small, sanitized sample log files (remove any sensitive info).

Optionally include a short video or GIF showing start â†’ activity â†’ stop.

In report.pdf, explain: purpose, high-level architecture, how you tested, and the security & privacy measures you took.

Security & Ethics (Must Read)

Legal: Monitoring devices without explicit consent may be illegal. Always get permission.

Ethical: Use this project only for education and research.

Data Safety: Sanitize any logs before submission â€” do not include real personal data or credentials.

Responsible Disclosure: If you find real vulnerabilities or sensitive data, inform your instructor immediately.
